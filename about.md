Omer is a final year Computer Engineering undergrad at National University of Singapore (NUS). He works part time as an iOS developer with the Future Urban Mobility Team at Singapore MIT Alliance for Research and Technology ([SMART](http://smart.mit.edu/)). 

He previously interned at Ubisoft Singapore where he worked as a scripter with the Assassins Creed III Animation Team.

He has an unhealthy obession with lisps and functional programming. He particularly enjoys clojure. These days he's journeying into Category theory and beginning to appreciate Haskell's type system.
